# Concurrent Traffic Simulation - Nucleo Board

**Description:**  
Created a concurrent traffic simulation system on a Nucleo board that handles both pedestrians and vehicles simultaneously. The system models traffic flow, signal coordination, and collision avoidance.  

**Techniques / Tools:**  
Nucleo board, C/C++, Embedded systems, Concurrency handling, Real-time simulation  

**My Role:**  
- Implemented concurrent processing to simulate multiple traffic entities  
- Programmed traffic logic for cars and pedestrians  
- Tested simulation under different traffic scenarios for performance and accuracy  

**Evidence / Visuals:**  
- Photos or video of the simulation in action  
- Flow diagrams of the traffic system logic
