# Image Processor – DE10-Lite FPGA Project

**Description:**  
Developed an image processing application using the DE10-Lite FPGA board. The system applies matrix multiplication techniques to modify images, allowing them to be sharpened or blurred.  

**Techniques / Tools:**  
FPGA (DE10-Lite), Verilog, Matrix Multiplication, Image Processing  

**My Role:**  
- Implemented image processing algorithms on the FPGA  
- Designed and tested matrix multiplication operations  
- Evaluated performance and adjusted parameters for sharpening and blurring effects
