# Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

**Description:**  
Built a digital-to-analog converter using physical components including resistors, operational amplifiers, and buffers. The project demonstrates understanding of analog electronics and circuit design principles.  

**Techniques / Tools:**  
Resistors, Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps), Buffers, Breadboard prototyping, Multimeter testing  

**My Role:**  
- Designed and assembled the DAC circuit  
- Tested and calibrated voltage outputs to ensure accuracy  
- Documented the circuit design and results  

**Evidence / Visuals:**  
- Circuit diagrams  
- Photos of the assembled DAC  
- Voltage output measurements
